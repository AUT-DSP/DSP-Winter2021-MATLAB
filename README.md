# Dicrete-time Signal Processing - MATLAB HW
## Dr. Hamid Sheikhzadeh

- Put all the codes relating to each question into a separate folder.
- There should be only **one pdf** which is your report for all the questions.
- Note that you must provide your answers in the form of a sample available in the
**MATLAB HW-Template.zip** file. [For each question, you have to comment and specify the
relevant sections of the questions, and finally publish it for each question. All
results (charts, images, audio files) should be included too]
- Charts that do not have labels, titles and axes have no scientific value, so specify
your figures accurately. (Examples are available in the instance file)
- Please do not cheat in any way, otherwise a score of 0 will be considered for you.
- Attach your zip file and name it like below: “HW1_ MATLAB_[StdNum].zip”
- Submit and upload your zip file in the Courses platform until deadline.
