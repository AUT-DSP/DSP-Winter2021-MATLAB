## Q1. RECONSTRUCTION
### A. Sampling
1. Write a MATLAB program to compute following Signals, where f = 10hz and the Time interval is [0,0.2]:

	<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = sin(2\pi ft) %2Bcos(4\pi ft)"><br/>
	
	
	<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = sawtooth(2\pi ft)">


2. Sample These Signals with Sampling Frequency 100Hz and discuss about the boundrys of Sampling Frequency in your Report and in your MATLAB code.

### B. Interpolation
A reconstruction filter on the output of a sampled data system. Provided the signal was sampled at a rate greater than twice the highest frequency present in the original, the output of a reconstruction filter will be identical to the original signal.

#### 1. Linear Interpolation
1. In Linear interpolation, the samples are simply connected to each other with strict line. Write a MATLAB program to compute Linear Interpolated Signal:(*Hint: interp1 Command*)

		vq = interp1(x,v,xq,"linear")

2. Compare the Reconstructed Signal with the Original one and state that where Maxima of Error happens.
3. is it possible to reconstruct all form of signals? explain the Error cause of Reconstruction of sawtooth signal.


#### 3. Additional Content: Polynomial Interpolation
The Lagrange interpolation is given mathematically by

where x(tk) is the value of the sample at instant tk and Lk(t) is the interpolating polynomial term multiplied by each sample value, and is given by

Note that the terms on the numerator are of the form (t − tk), and the terms on the denominator are of the form (tk − ti), with the single term (tk − tk) removed from both the numerator and denominator. At the sample time t = tk (corresponding to the current “center” of interpolation), the interpolating function Lk(tk) = 1 because the numerator will equal the denominator. 

At time instants corresponding to one of the other known samples, say, t = tk + 1, one of the numerator terms will be zero, and thus the interpolating function Lk(tk + 1) = 0. Therefore, the interpolation is guaranteed to pass through the known samples with weighting of one:
